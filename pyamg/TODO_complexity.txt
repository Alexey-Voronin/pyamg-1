- Not doing for adaptive, because old adaptive code is a mess.

- Relaxation on targets
	+ Need to account for Schwarz - is this done on targets?
- Aggregation
	+ Cost implemented for classical aggregation
	+ Cost implemented for naive aggregation
	+ Not implemented for lloyd
- Smoothing P
	+ Implemented for Richardson 
	+ Started Jacobi, havenâ€™t accounted for constraints
	+ Energy
		~ Need to account for SatisfyConstraints()
		  and incomplete_mat_mul() in cg, cg_nr, germs (search TODO)
		~ most of Main function done, except compute_BtBinv()
		  and filter_operator()
- Strength
	+ Not implemented for distance
	+ Done for classical
	+ Done for symmetric
	+ Not implemented for energy 
	+ Evolution 
		~ Started, need to finish (search TODO)
	+ Started for algebraic distance
	+ Started for affinity distance
- Split (classical)
	+ Not implemented in any CF-splittings
	+ Not implemented in CR
+ Interpolate (classical)
	+ Not implemented
- In code
	+ Accounted for RAP
	+ Accounted for diagonal dominance
	+ Accounted for non-symmetric
	+ Accounted for tentative T
	+ Accounted for improving bad guys
