- Not doing for adaptive, because old adaptive code is a mess.

- Relaxation on targets
	+ Started relaxation_as_linear_operator in utils.py
		~ Think use estimates Jacob wrote, 1 WU, 2 WU, etc. based on smoother
		~ What about Schwarz?
- Aggregation
	+ Cost implemented for classical aggregation
	+ Cost implemented for naive aggregation
	+ Not implemented for lloyd
- Smoothing P
	+ Implemented for Richardson 
	+ Started Jacobi, haven’t accounted for constraints
	+ Haven’t done energy 
- Strength
	+ Not implemented for distance
	+ Done for classical
	+ Done for symmetric
	+ Not implemented for energy 
	+ Not implemented for evolution 
	+ Started for algebraic distance
	+ Started for affinity distance
- Split (classical)
	+ Not implemented in any CF-splittings
	+ Not implemented in CR
+ Interpolate (classical)
	+ Not implemented
- In code
	+ Accounted for RAP
	+ Accounted for diagonal dominance
	+ Accounted for non-symmetric
	+ Have not accounted for fit candidates (rn or sa)
	+ Have not accounted for creating root node matrices (rn)
	+ Have not accounted for injecting numb space modes (rn)
